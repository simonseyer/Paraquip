With Paraquip you'll never forget to check your paragliding equipment again. It's easy to keep a record and be notified of upcoming checks.

Simply put your paraglider, harness, and rescue into the app and enter your checks. The app shows you directly when the next check is due and notifies you in advance. So that your equipment is always ready, even for spontaneous paragliding trips.

To optimize performance and safety, the app automatically calculates whether the paraglider & rescue are within the weight range and helps you choose a good wing loading.
